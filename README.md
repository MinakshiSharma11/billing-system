This Billing System project is developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and file handling for data persistence. 
It is designed to streamline the billing process by allowing users to add, edit, and remove items from their final billing receipt.
The system dynamically calculates and displays the total amount of the bill and generates a detailed receipt at the end.
With a simple and user-friendly console interface, this project demonstrates effective use of classes and file operations to simulate a real-world billing experience.
